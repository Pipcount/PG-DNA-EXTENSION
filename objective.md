# Main objectives
## Done
- [x] Data types
- [x] Length functions
- [x] Generate Kmers
- [x] Equals / Startswith
- [x] Contains
- [x] Kmer counting support / Grouping operations
- [x] Index SP-GiST trie-based
---
## To do
- [x] Test on a real dataset
- [ ] Presentation
- [ ] static for kmer_val_to_string
---
## Additional
- [x] Improve Qkmer matching
- [x] Link header files correctly so we don't have to redefine every function
- [ ] Test qkmer matching against string implementation


## Presentation
- [x] Datatypes + justification + casts + length
- [x] functions (equal, startswith, match, generate)
- [x] Kmer counting -> hashing
- [x] SP-GIST 
- [ ] Demo on how a request works under the hood
